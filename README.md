# Linear-Search
project for CISC 121 fall 2025

# Algorithm Name
linear search.
I choose linear search, because I think it is straightforward to understand, and I can finish the project smoothly and successfully.

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the four pillars of computational thinking briefly in bullets)




1. Decomposition

As a user, he/she needs to input 5 numbers into the first box and one numbers into target box.
then press the "start" but
The computer will compare the numbers one by one until it finds the target number or determines that it is not present.

2. Pattern Recognition

check the numbers, if the numbers are between -100 and 100, then proceed.
otherwise, print out: "error".


3. Abstraction
    
Through coding, the computer compares two numbers: one from the first box and the other from the target box.

4. Algorithm Design

5 numbers are in a line, such as A, B, C, D, E. the target is T.<br>
( -100<A, B, C, D, E, T<100) <br>
Step 1: <br>
Pick up the 1st element (A) from the line and compare it with the target (T). <br> 
If A==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 1.  <br>
If A≠T, we do the step 2.  <br>
Step 2:  <br>
Pick up the 2nd element (B) from the line and compare it with the target (T).  <br> 
If B==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 2.  <br>
If B≠T, we do the step 3.<br>
Step 3:<br>
Pick up the 3rd element (C) from the line and compare it with the target (T). <br>
If C==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 3.<br>
If C≠T, we do the step 4.<br>
Step 4:<br>
Pick up the 4th element (D) from the line and compare it with the target (T). <br>
If D==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 4.<br>
If D≠T, we do the step 5.<br>
Step 5:<br>
Pick up the 5th element (E) from the line and compare it with the target (T).<br>
If E==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 5.<br>
If E≠T, Print put: There is no target in line.<br>
