# Linear-Search
<br>
project for CISC 121 fall 2025
<br>

# Algorithm Name
<br>
linear search.
<br>
I choose linear search, because I think it is straightforward to understand, and I can finish the project smoothly and successfully.

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the four pillars of computational thinking briefly in bullets)
<br>



1. Decomposition
<br>
1) we need the coding, and we can get help from AI tools
<br>
2) we need test the coding, maybe in jupyter notebook
  <br>
3) we need to create a public link
  <br>
4) we need to test the public link. <br>

2. Pattern Recognition
<br>
check the numbers, if the numbers are between -100 and 100, then proceed. <br>

otherwise, print out: "error". <br>


3. Abstraction
    <br>
Through coding, the computer compares two numbers: one is from the first line box (from the left to right), and the other is from the target box. <br>

4. Algorithm Design
<br>
5 numbers are in a line, such as A, B, C, D, E. the target is T. <br>
( -100<A, B, C, D, E, T<100) <br>
Step 1: <br>
Pick up the 1st element (A) from the line and compare it with the target (T). <br> 
If A==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 1.  <br>
If A≠T, we do the step 2.  <br>
Step 2:  <br>
Pick up the 2nd element (B) from the line and compare it with the target (T).  <br> 
If B==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 2.  <br>
If B≠T, we do the step 3.<br>
Step 3:<br>
Pick up the 3rd element (C) from the line and compare it with the target (T). <br>
If C==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 3.<br>
If C≠T, we do the step 4.<br>
Step 4:<br>
Pick up the 4th element (D) from the line and compare it with the target (T). <br>
If D==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 4.<br>
If D≠T, we do the step 5.<br>
Step 5:<br>
Pick up the 5th element (E) from the line and compare it with the target (T).<br>
If E==T. we are done. Print put: The target is in position 5.<br>
If E≠T, Print put: There is no target in line.<br>



## Steps to Run
<br>
Here are two ways to run the program, I introduce them A and B. <br>

Option <br>

1. download  "Anaconda-Navigator" <br>
<img width="312" height="296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36aa5a66-7510-4326-a87b-7edb592ab463" /><br>

2. install Anaconda-Navigator <br>

3. open the "Terminal" <br>

<br>

4. copy the coding into the cell<br>

   the program was generated by Anaconda Assistant 4.18.0 <br>

   

6. click " shift + trturn"<br>

7. it is done as shown below <br>

<br>

Option B <br>

1. otherwise, click the link:
<br>

<br>
2. 

 you can see 
<br>

<br>

3.
As a user, he/she needs to input 5 numbers into the first line of the left box and one numbers in the second line. 
<br>

All numbers must be between -100 and 100, otherwise the result shows "Error: All numbers must be between -100 and 100."
<br>

Then click the "search" button. <br>

the coding was generated by Anaconda Assistant 4.18.0 
<br>

I tested it in JUPYTER notebook
